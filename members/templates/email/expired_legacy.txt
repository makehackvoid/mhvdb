Hi {{m.first_name}},

Your old-style MHV membership expired today. :(

If you believe this is wrong, or have already paid, please reply to this email and so we can update the database.

You're still welcome to come to Maker Meetup events.

If you want to continue your membership, the new membership and access rates and payment details can be found at:

http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/membership

You can make a bank transfer with your annual membership fee and any access payments you want to make, and then reply to this email and let us know so we can enter the payment into our system.
