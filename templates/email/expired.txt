Hi {{m.first_name}},

Your MHV membership expired today. :(

If you believe this is wrong, or have already paid, please reply to
this email and tell us to lift our game!

You're still welcome to access the space as a Casual member, or come to Maker Meetup events.


If you want to continue your membership, current membership rates and
payment details can be found at:

http://www.makehackvoid.com/community/membership#associate

You can make a bank transfer with your membership dues (as many months
as you like), and then reply to this email and let us know so we can
enter the payment into our system.
