mhvdb is a Django app for tracking the state of the [Make, Hack, Void](http://www.makehackvoid.com/)
hackerspace membership. We hope you might find it useful for your
Hackerspace or similar organisation, as well.

It is not very fancy, it mostly leverages Django Admin Interface to do
the heavy lifting.

Features
========

* Provides management of memberships by levels, pro rate upgrades &
  downgrades & membership cost reductions.

* Provides management of expenses, income & balance sheet predictions,
  and simple financial reports.

* Provides easy summary page of soon-to-expire or just-expired memberships.

* Allow a local IP range that can view some common data (membership
  roster, expiries, members' emergency contact info) without logging in
  (see LOCAL_IP_ADDRESSES in settings.py)

* Over 50% Yak Hair Free

Not Features
============

"Things that it would be nice for mhvdb to do, but it doesn't quite do yet"

* Full Dual-Entry accounting for income & expenses, or at least better
  management of cash payments & especially cash deposits.

* Emailing members when their membership is about to expire, and/or the Treasurer
  once membership has expired.

* Management of expense requests/approval, for people claiming money back from the hackerspace

* Integration with payment gateways or bank APIs for automatic data entry.


Requirements
============

* Django 1.2 or newer.

* [django-evolution](http://code.google.com/p/django-evolution/) (easy_install django-evolution) for schema management.

Configuration
=============

Create a local_settings.py file for any site-specific additions or changes to settings.py.

There is a comment at the top of settings.py that explains what definitely needs to be in your local_settings.py.


Getting Started
===============

* Set up local_settings.py as described above. "./manage.py syncdb" if necessary to create a database.

* Create an admin account "./manage.py createsuperuser"

* If running with the Django debug server, "./manage.py runserver" and note the site URL.

* Open the site URL, click on 'Admin', and log in with your new admin account

* Create essential data about your organisation:
  # "Memberships" are types of membership offered (ie MHV has 'Associate' and 'Full' membership.)
    # By default, mhvdb assumes you'll add a membership type called "Casual" for any new member, or member
      whose membership expires. You can override the name of this type in overide_settings.py
  # "Membership Costs" are associated with each membership, giving a per-month rate. Costs can change over
    time, each cost has a "valid from" field which determines when it applies from. If a membership's costs go
    down over time, mhvdb will automatically grant a pro rata extension of membership to current members
    already paid (the converse does not apply, if membership costs go up there is no pro rata shortening!)

* Add specific data from your organisation:
  # "Member" is self-explanatory, basic personal data about members.
    # Each Member has one or more "Member Payments", which are the payments they make to become members.

  # Expenses & Income are for one-off costs or income the organisation incurs.

  # RecurringExpenses are for costs that repeat reliably over a period of time.


FAQ
===

* How do I add a membership renewal?
  # View the member's entry under Admin -> Members, and there is a list of Member Payments at the bottom.
    Add a new one for the member, making sure the "Continues Membership" box is checked if this is a renewal.

* What happens if a member upgrades/downgrades their membership type before it expires?
  # Supported! Add a new Member Payment (it can be $0 if they're not paying anything at that time), with the
    new membership type and check "Existing Member Changing Type". Their membership will be
    recalculated as the new type, reusing any left over membership they had from the old type.
